    <h2>Using Tucan Fitness</h2>
    <h3>How do I use and connect with Strava?</h3>

    <h3>Help my strava activities arenâ€™t showing up</h3>
    <p> Strava sometimes takes a while to send activities to us, especially biking activities. If this persists for over 24 hours, go to your profile, unauthenticate, and reauthenticate with Strava. If issues persist, please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@tucan.fitness">admin@tucan.fitness</a>.</p>
