<h2>Inactive vs Active Items</h2>
<p>Merch and registration items for a race are either <strong>ACTIVE</strong> or <strong>INACTIVE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVE</strong> items are visible to racers who join a race. On the other hand, <strong>INACTIVE</strong> items are not publicly visible and are only accessible by a race's owner via the race dashboard.</p>
<p>An item's state can be set to ACTIVE or INACTIVE by an owner only.</p>
