         <h2>How does this all work?</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Tucan Fitness! When your race starts, you will have access to a digital race where you can strive to win, interact with other racers, and visualize yours and others progress on a virtual map. We integrate with Strava to allow easy access to your fitness activities.

          Until race day begins and you have access to the race on your profile, you can sit back and relax (or train like crazy). <b>We recommend that you use this time to do the action items below to best prep for race day.</b>
