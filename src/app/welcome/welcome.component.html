    <h2>How does this all work?</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Tucan Fitness! When your race starts, you will have access to a digital race where you can strive to win, interact with other racers, and visualize yours and others progress on a virtual map. We integrate with Strava to allow easy access to your fitness activities.

    Until race day begins (make sure to go to your profile and view “Current Races” if you are unsure of the start date), you can sit back and relax (or train like crazy). We recommend that you use this time to do the action items below to best prep for race day. On race day, you can visit the URL that your race director sends out, or easily navigate to the race on your profile.

Once you have an account, press the button below to connect it to our platform. This will allow your Strava activities to show up into the race. Only activities recorded after race start will be counted towards your race.
