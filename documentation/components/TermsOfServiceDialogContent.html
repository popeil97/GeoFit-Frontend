  &lt;p&gt;The Tucan websites, related mobile applications and services (collectively, the “Services”) are made available to you by Tucan Fitness, Inc. subject to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and in accordance with the &lt;a target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10QQWYdAo97Ny-ezDXuXDjtTrPgrYocg0fVgHA1DfJFo/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing&quot;&gt;Tucan Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; (the “Privacy Policy”). You agree to comply with these Terms and any supplemental terms which Tucan makes available to you on the Services which shall form part of the Terms. BY ACCESSING, USING OR UPLOADING OR DOWNLOADING ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS TO OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR BY INDICATING YOUR ASSENT TO THESE TERMS BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT, CLICKING “SIGN UP” OR ANY SIMILAR MECHANISM, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES. This agreement was written in English. To the extent a translated version of the Terms conflict with the English version, the English version controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  

  &lt;p&gt;If you access or use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms and that it is fully binding on them. In such case, the term “you” will refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have authority, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms contain disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability that may be applicable to you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Tucan Services cannot be provided and the agreement described in these Terms of Service cannot be performed without Tucan processing data about you, and other Tucan members, possibly including your location data. Processing of the data you share with Tucan is essential to the Services which we provide and a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and Tucan are resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate, which will, unless you reside in the European Union, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration and limit you to claims against Tucan on an individual basis, unless you opt-out in accordance with the instructions below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Registration and Accounts
    The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To use the Services, you must register. You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (“Member Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Member Data. You agree that Tucan may use your Member Data to provide Services that you access or use and as otherwise set forth in these Terms. If you provide any Member Data that is inaccurate or not current, or Tucan has reasonable grounds to suspect that such Member Data is inaccurate or not current, Tucan has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse current or future use of the Services. In consideration of your use of the Services, you represent that you are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer and mobile devices. We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your Content (as defined below) or the personal information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree to immediately notify Tucan of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to Member Data and any other information or content you provide to Tucan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You may connect your account to other services, such as Strava. If you do so, you hereby authorize Tucan to pre-populate the registration and other relevant information fields of your account and/or to use such third-party credentials to log you into your account. You also authorize Tucan to pull activity data from that account. If you connect your account to a third-party network, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such third party.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Payments and Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Payments&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To pay any fee, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (e.g., credit card, online payment service, a third party, like PayPal, or any other payment method made available by Tucan) (the “Payment Method”). If you provide your payment information, you authorize us and certain third party service providers, payment card networks and payment processors to receive, store and encrypt your payment information. If you paid through the Google Play or iTunes store, you may change your Payment Method through the corresponding store account. No refunds or credits will be provided by Tucan, other than as set forth in these Terms. If your payment provider determines that there are fraudulent charges on your account resulting from use of your Payment Method at the Services, please contact us immediately via admin@tucan.fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Fees&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In order to access certain functionality of the Services, you may be required to pay race fees. All race fees are payable in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Member Content and Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You own the information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, posts, tags, or other materials you make available in connection with the Services (“Content”), whether publicly posted, privately transmitted, or submitted through a third party API (e.g. a photograph submitted via Strava). You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display any Content and any name, username or likeness that you post on or in connection with the Services in all media formats and channels now known or later developed without compensation to you. This license ends when you delete your Content or your account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You understand that you, and not Tucan, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Services. Tucan does not proactively and routinely screen or monitor the Content posted to the Services by others and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Tucan may, in its sole discretion, screen, monitor, refuse or remove any Content, or remove any Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Tucan be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content made available on the Services. You agree to bear all risks associated with the use of any Content available in connection with the Services, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You agree that Tucan is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted on the Services. If your Content violates these Terms, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content. As between you and Tucan, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Tucan is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Tucan in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. Your Content will not be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Tucan other than as set forth in our Privacy Policy and your privacy controls, and Tucan will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Services may provide you with the ability to mark certain Content that you submit to the Services as private, public, or available only to select users of the Services. Tucan will maintain the privacy of such Content in accordance with your elections. However, if you do not elect to mark your Content as private or available for a limited group of members, or later change such designation to allow such Content to be made available to anyone, you are responsible for the public nature of the content. Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how to manage your privacy controls.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You give us permission to use your profile name, profile photo, and information about your activities and actions you have taken, including your use of third party products, services, or devices, in ads, offers and other commercial contexts on the Tucan service without compensation to you.&lt;/p&gt;

            You are granted a limited, non-exclusive right to create a text hyperlink to the Services for non-commercial use only, provided such link does not portray Tucan or any of its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory or otherwise defamatory manner, and provided further that the linking site does not contain any pornographic, illegal, offensive, harassing or otherwise objectionable material. You are further granted a right to implement any RSS feeds located on the Services for your personal, non-commercial use, solely as described on the Services.

    &lt;h3&gt;Interactions with Members&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Services function as a venue to connect members in a virtual information place.

    &lt;h3&gt;Third Parties&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third party products and services made available on the Services are made and offered directly by the applicable third party. When you pursue or purchase any such product or service, you acknowledge that you are contracting directly with such third party and not with Tucan. Your interaction with, or participation in promotions of, third parties found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, are solely between you and such third party.

YOU AGREE THAT TUCAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCURRED BY YOU AS THE RESULT OF ANY OF YOUR DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR ADVERTISERS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tucan or third parties may provide links to other internet sites or resources through the Services. Tucan does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, information, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources.

    &lt;p&gt;You acknowledge and agree that the Services, any necessary software used in connection with the Services (if any), any aggregated data based on Content on the Services, and any Content available or made available on the Services contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Except as expressly permitted by applicable law or authorized by Tucan or applicable third party service providers or advertisers, you agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the Services, the software or Content available on the Services (other than Content that you may submit), in whole or in part.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tucan grants you a personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive right and license to access and use the Services; provided that you do not (and do not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work from, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Services, except where permitted by law. You agree not to access the Services by any means other than through the interfaces that are provided by Tucan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The term TUCAN, the Tucan logo and other Tucan logos and product and service names are owned by, Tucan Fitness, Inc., and you may not use or display such trademarks in any manner without Tucan’s prior written permission. Any third party trademarks or service marks displayed on the Services are the property of their respective owners.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tucan reserves all rights not expressly granted hereunder.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Claims of Infringement&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Tucan also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Tucan infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Tucan to locate the material on the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Tucan will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Tucan determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, Tucan will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.

        If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located; or, if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Tucan may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see https://copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there may be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT TUCAN IS NOT PROVIDING MEDICAL ADVICE VIA THE SERVICES. THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL TEXT, PHOTOGRAPHS, IMAGES, ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHICS, AUDIO, VIDEO AND AUDIO-VIDEO CLIPS, AND OTHER MATERIALS, WHETHER PROVIDED BY US OR BY OTHER ACCOUNT HOLDERS OR THIRD PARTIES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PLACE OF (a) THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, (b) A VISIT, CALL OR CONSULTATION WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, OR (c) INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OR IN ANY PRODUCT PACKAGING OR LABEL.

THE TRANSMISSION AND RECEIPT OF OUR CONTENT, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OR COMMUNICATION VIA THE INTERNET, E-MAIL OR OTHER MEANS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE OR CREATE A DOCTOR-PATIENT, THERAPIST-PATIENT OR OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND TUCAN.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CYCLING, RUNNING, OR PARTICIPATING IN A RACE, CHALLENGE, OR EVENT OFFERED ON THE SERVICES) CARRY CERTAIN INHERENT AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, BODILY INJURY OR DEATH AND THAT YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR PART BY THE ACTION, INACTION OR NEGLIGENCE OF TUCAN OR BY THE ACTION, INACTION OR NEGLIGENCE OF OTHERS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT TUCAN DOES NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INSPECTION, SUPERVISION, PREPARATION, OR CONDUCT OF ANY RACE, CONTEST, CHALLENGE, OR GROUP ACTIVITY THAT UTILIZES THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY THAT ARE ORGANIZED BY A TUCAN ADMINISTRATOR.&lt;/p&gt;

YOU ALSO AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE RELEASED PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH (a) YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE SERVICES, (b) YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF EQUIPMENT OR PROGRAMS CREATED OR LICENSED BY TUCAN (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY TUCAN RACES, CHALLENGES, OR EVENTS)) WHILE ENGAGED IN ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES, (c) YOUR DEALINGS WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR ADVERTISERS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, (d) ANY DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXPERIENCED BY YOU, OR (e) ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF TUCAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ABOVE, SUCH AS EXCLUSIONS FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF, SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, (AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE, COUNTRY OR TERRITORY), WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;TUCAN DOES NOT ENDORSE YOUR CONTENT OR ANY OTHER MEMBER’S CONTENT AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE (WHETHER ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE), INJURY, CLAIM, LIABILITY OR OTHER CAUSE OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER BASED UPON OR RESULTING FROM ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER RESIDING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU HAVE LEGAL REMEDIES IF WE CAUSE YOU LOSS BY OUR BREACH OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF OUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, OR BY OUR NEGLIGENCE, AND THESE TERMS DO NOT AFFECT THOSE STATUTORY REMEDIES.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Indemnity&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You agree to indemnify and hold Tucan and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, representatives, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise seek to make available through the Services, your use of the Services, your athletic activities which generate the Content you post or seek to post on the Services (including, but not limited to, athletic activities in connection with any contests, races, group rides, or other events which Tucan sponsors, organizes, participates in, or whose Services are used in connection with), your connection to the Services, your violation of the Terms, your violation of any data protection or privacy laws, or your violation of any rights of another person or entity. Your rights with respect to Tucan are not modified by the foregoing indemnification if the laws of your country of residence, applicable as a result of your use of our Services, do not permit it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Notice for California Members&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Services members are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Dispute Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Arbitration&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Except for disputes relating to the Tucan’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents) or if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its provisions and procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Tucan will pay the additional cost. You and Tucan hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Tucan is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. This provision does not apply to users who live in the European Union.

        The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Class-Action Waiver&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Exception—Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;United States Operation&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This Services are controlled by Tucan from its offices within the United States of America. Tucan makes no representation that the Content or the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Content in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Termination&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You agree that Tucan may, under certain serious circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate your account and/or access to the Services. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of the Terms or other incorporated agreements, policies or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Services (or any portion thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (f) extended periods of inactivity, and/or (g) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Services. Termination of your account may include (x) removal of access to all offerings within the Services, (y) deletion of your information, files and Content associated with your account, and (z) barring of further use of the Services. Further, you agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Tucan’s sole discretion and that Tucan shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account or access to the Services.

    &lt;h3&gt;General&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You agree that no joint venture, partnership, joint controllership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and Tucan as a result of the Terms or your use of the Services. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Tucan with respect to your use of the Services. The failure of Tucan to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Tucan. Tucan has the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Services. Tucan’s notice to you via email, regular mail or notices, posts, or links on the Services shall constitute acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Section titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Modification of the Terms and Services&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Certain provisions of the Terms may be supplemented or superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages on the Services. Tucan reserves the right to update the Terms at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. Tucan will notify you of any material changes to the Terms or to any service or other features of the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have provided you with notice of a modification, you are agreeing to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.&lt;/p&gt;

Processing of the data you share with Tucan is essential to the Services which we provide and a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.</p>  <p>Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and Tucan are resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate, which will, unless you reside in the European Union, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration and limit you to claims against Tucan on an individual basis, unless you opt-out in accordance with the instructions below.</p>  <p>Registration and Accounts    The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.    </p>    <p>To use the Services, you must register.

Your Content will not be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Tucan other than as set forth in our Privacy Policy and your privacy controls, and Tucan will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</p>    <p>The Services may provide you with the ability to mark certain Content that you submit to the Services as private, public, or available only to select users of the Services. Tucan will maintain the privacy of such Content in accordance with your elections. However, if you do not elect to mark your Content as private or available for a limited group of members, or later change such designation to allow such Content to be made available to anyone, you are responsible for the public nature of the content. Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how to manage your privacy controls.</p>    <p>You give us permission to use your profile name, profile photo, and information about your activities and actions you have taken, including your use of third party products, services, or devices, in ads, offers and other commercial contexts on the Tucan service without compensation to you.</p>    <h3>Conduct</h3>    <p>We expect you to honor the TucanCommunity Standards.

Any third party trademarks or service marks displayed on the Services are the property of their respective owners.</p>    <p>Tucan reserves all rights not expressly granted hereunder.</p>    <h3>Claims of Infringement</h3>    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Tucan also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Tucan infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Tucan to locate the material on the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Tucan will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Tucan determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, Tucan will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.        If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located; or, if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Tucan may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).        </p>    <p>Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see https://copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there may be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>    <p>Agent to Receive Notices of Claimed Infringement:</p>    <p>admin@tucan.fitness</p>    <h3>Your Feedback</h3>    <p>        We welcome your comments, feedback, suggestions, and other communications regarding the Services and the information and services we make available through the Services (collectively, “Feedback”).

IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF, SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, (AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE, COUNTRY OR TERRITORY), WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>    <p>TUCAN DOES NOT ENDORSE YOUR CONTENT OR ANY OTHER MEMBER’S CONTENT AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE (WHETHER ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE), INJURY, CLAIM, LIABILITY OR OTHER CAUSE OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER BASED UPON OR RESULTING FROM ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES.</p>    <p>IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER RESIDING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU HAVE LEGAL REMEDIES IF WE CAUSE YOU LOSS BY OUR BREACH OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF OUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, OR BY OUR NEGLIGENCE, AND THESE TERMS DO NOT AFFECT THOSE STATUTORY REMEDIES.</p>    <h3>Indemnity</h3>    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Tucan and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, representatives, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise seek to make available through the Services, your use of the Services, your athletic activities which generate the Content you post or seek to post on the Services (including, but not limited to, athletic activities in connection with any contests, races, group rides, or other events which Tucan sponsors, organizes, participates in, or whose Services are used in connection with), your connection to the Services, your violation of the Terms, your violation of any data protection or privacy laws, or your violation of any rights of another person or entity. Your rights with respect to Tucan are not modified by the foregoing indemnification if the laws of your country of residence, applicable as a result of your use of our Services, do not permit it.</p>    <h3>Notice for California Members</h3>    <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Services members are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>    <h3>Arbitration</h3>    <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Except for disputes relating to the Tucan’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents) or if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its provisions and procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Tucan will pay the additional cost. You and Tucan hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Tucan is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. This provision does not apply to users who live in the European Union.        The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.        </p>    <h3>Class-Action Waiver</h3>    <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>    <h3>Exception—Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims</h3>    <p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>    <h3>United States Operation</h3>    <p>This Services are controlled by Tucan from its offices within the United States of America. Tucan makes no representation that the Content or the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Access to or use of the Content or the Services from territories where such access or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Content in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.</p>    <h3>Termination</h3>    <p>You agree that Tucan may, under certain serious circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate your account and/or access to the Services. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of the Terms or other incorporated agreements, policies or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Services (or any portion thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (f) extended periods of inactivity, and/or (g) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Services. Termination of your account may include (x) removal of access to all offerings within the Services, (y) deletion of your information, files and Content associated with your account, and (z) barring of further use of the Services. Further, you agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Tucan’s sole discretion and that Tucan shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account or access to the Services. The following Sections shall survive termination of your account and/or the Terms: Member Content Submitted to the Services, Proprietary Rights, Your Feedback, Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability, Indemnity, Applicable Laws and General.</p>    <h3>General</h3>    <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, joint controllership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and Tucan as a result of the Terms or your use of the Services. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Tucan with respect to your use of the Services. The failure of Tucan to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Tucan. Tucan has the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Services. Tucan’s notice to you via email, regular mail or notices, posts, or links on the Services shall constitute acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Section titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>    <h3>Modification of the Terms and Services</h3>    <p>Certain provisions of the Terms may be supplemented or superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages on the Services. Tucan reserves the right to update the Terms at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. Tucan will notify you of any material changes to the Terms or to any service or other features of the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have provided you with notice of a modification, you are agreeing to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.</p>    <p>Tucan and its third party service providers may make improvements and/or changes in the Services, products, services, mobile applications, features, programs, and prices described at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. The mobile application may download and install upgrades, updates and additional features in order to improve, enhance, and further develop the Services. Tucan reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any portion thereof with or without notice. You agree that Tucan shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services.</p>    <h3>Support and Questions</h3>    <p>We will respond to any questions regarding the Services and these Terms via admin@tucan.fitness. We generally respond to support requests within 10-14 days after the request is placed (or sooner).</p></mat-dialog-content><mat-dialog-actions align="end">  <button mat-button mat-dialog-close>Close</button></mat-dialog-actions></div>'
